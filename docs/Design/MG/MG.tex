\section{Introduction}

Decomposing a system into modules is a commonly accepted approach to developing
software.  A module is a work assignment for a programmer or programming
team~\citep{ParnasEtAl1984}.  We advocate a decomposition
based on the principle of information hiding~\citep{Parnas1972a}.  This
principle supports design for change, because the ``secrets'' that each module
hides represent likely future changes.  Design for change is valuable in SC,
where modifications are frequent, especially during initial development as the
solution space is explored.  

Our design follows the rules layed out by \citet{ParnasEtAl1984}, as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item System details that are likely to change independently should be the
  secrets of separate modules.
\item Each data structure is used in only one module.
\item Any other program that requires information stored in a module's data
  structures must obtain it by calling access programs belonging to that module.
\end{itemize}

After completing the first stage of the design, the Software Requirements
Specification (SRS), the Module Guide (MG) is developed~\citep{ParnasEtAl1984}. The MG
specifies the modular structure of the system and is intended to allow both
designers and maintainers to easily identify the parts of the software.  The
potential readers of this document are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item New project members: This document can be a guide for a new project member
  to easily understand the overall structure and quickly find the
  relevant modules they are searching for.
\item Maintainers: The hierarchical structure of the module guide improves the
  maintainers' understanding when they need to make changes to the system. It is
  important for a maintainer to update the relevant sections of the document
  after changes have been made.
\item Designers: Once the module guide has been written, it can be used to
  check for consistency, feasibility and flexibility. Designers can verify the
  system in various ways, such as consistency among modules, feasibility of the
  decomposition, and flexibility of the design.
\end{itemize}

The rest of the document is organized as follows. Section
\ref{SecChange} lists the anticipated and unlikely changes of the software
requirements. Section \ref{SecMH} summarizes the module decomposition that
was constructed according to the likely changes. Section \ref{SecConnection}
specifies the connections between the software requirements and the
modules. Section \ref{SecMD} gives a detailed description of the
modules. Section \ref{SecTM} includes two traceability matrices. One checks
the completeness of the design against the requirements provided in the SRS. The
other shows the relation between anticipated changes and the modules. Section
\ref{SecUse} describes the use relation between modules.

\section{Anticipated and Unlikely Changes} \label{SecChange}

This section lists possible changes to the system. According to the likeliness
of the change, the possible changes are classified into two
categories. Anticipated changes are listed in Section \ref{SecAchange}, and
unlikely changes are listed in Section \ref{SecUchange}.

\subsection{Anticipated Changes} \label{SecAchange}

Anticipated changes are the source of the information that is to be hidden
inside the modules. Ideally, changing one of the anticipated changes will only
require changing the one module that hides the associated decision. The approach
adapted here is called design for
change.

\begin{description}
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acHardware}:] Hardware used to 
run the software.
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acInput}:] Format of the input 
data. The number of inputs may also change, which is dependent on the data 
structure used. \meow{For example, the Ring updating rule is dependent on 
inputs, but a vanilla GA wouldn't need such an updating rule. There might also 
be a data structure where more inputs would be required.}
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acRMSD}:] The RMSD module may 
be re-written or changed to use another library. The reasons for switching the 
RMSD library would be either an increase in performance or an easier 
installation process.
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acRing}:] The ring may change 
to another data structure. \wss{Can you create an abstract data structure that
  anticipates the future possibilities?} 
\meow{See my comments below. I think I accounted for all of my changes.}
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acFit_G}:] The calculation for 
$Fit_G$ may be expanded to include more formats than initially described in the 
SRS document.

\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acOutputDevice}:] \progname{} 
may be required to run on cell phones through a mobile application or web 
interface. The input/output device therefore will change from a keyboard and 
mouse to a touchscreen.
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acEnergy}:] The external 
program used to run the energy calculations may change or multiple choices may 
become available (depending on user input).
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acGeometry}:] The format of the 
solutions to the GA may change. The dihedral angles may be generated 
differently, and thus it may not be viable how the dihedral angles are 
recombined with the original geometry as in the Geometry module.
\meow{This AC is to accommodate for my supervisor's comments, where my 
assumptions about the ordering of atoms and generation of valid dihedral angles 
was incorrect. A\ref{A:atom-ordering} was incorrect.}.
\end{description}

In order to accommodate for a change in data structure, the input parameters 
could be expanded/modified to include:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Add num\_levels parameter.
	\item Add ga\_type; choose from Vanilla, Ring, and King of the Hill (KOTH).
\end{enumerate}

The Vanilla data structure should be filled throughout the optimization, 
whereas the Ring and KOTH data structures can have empty slots. To initialize a 
KOTH data structure, this step would involve making many Ring data structures 
of varying sizes. The updating rule would also change such that unless the 
smallest (``top") ring was being updated, then the tournament would be 
conducted across Rings. Therefore, a num\_rings input would be required to see 
how many Rings are in the data structure. Tournament selection for a Vanilla 
data structure occurs whereby the two worst population members from a selection 
are replaced with two children as generated from the two best population 
members from the selection. The other change needed in going from Vanilla 
and/or Ring to KOTH would be to have lists for num\_filled and num\_slots 
(since these values would simply be 1 item long for the Vanilla and Ring). A 
constraint on these values for Vanilla would be that num\_filled has to be 
equal to num\_slots.

\subsection{Unlikely Changes} \label{SecUchange}

The module design should be as general as possible. However, a general system is
more complex. Sometimes this complexity is not necessary. Fixing some design
decisions at the system architecture stage can simplify the software design. If
these decision should later need to be changed, then many parts of the design
will potentially need to be modified. Hence, it is not intended that these
decisions will be changed.

\begin{description}
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucGA}:] The genetic algorithm 
component is unlikely to be exchanged for another algorithm.
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucEnery}:] The energy is 
unlikely to be calculated using methods other than those from quantum mechanics.
\end{description}

\section{Module Hierarchy} \label{SecMH}

This section provides an overview of the module design. Modules are summarized
in a hierarchy decomposed by secrets in Table \ref{TblMH}. The modules listed
below, which are leaves in the hierarchy tree, are the modules that will
actually be implemented.

\begin{description}

\item [\refstepcounter{mnum} \mthemnum \label{mGAIn}:] GA Input
\item [\refstepcounter{mnum} \mthemnum \label{mMolIn}:] Molecule Input
\item [\refstepcounter{mnum} \mthemnum \label{mGAC}:] GA Control
\item [\refstepcounter{mnum} \mthemnum \label{mFitg}:] $Fit_G$
\item [\refstepcounter{mnum} \mthemnum \label{mTour}:] Tournament

\section{Connection Between Requirements and Design} \label{SecConnection}

The design of the system is intended to satisfy the requirements developed in
the SRS. In this stage, the system is decomposed into modules. The connection
between requirements and modules is listed in Table \ref{TblRT}.

\section{Module Decomposition} \label{SecMD}

Modules are decomposed according to the principle of ``information hiding''
proposed by \citet{ParnasEtAl1984}. The \emph{Secrets} field in a module
decomposition is a brief statement of the design decision hidden by the
module. The \emph{Services} field specifies \emph{what} the module will do
without documenting \emph{how} to do it. For each module, a suggestion for the
implementing software is given under the \emph{Implemented By} title. If the
entry is \emph{OS}, this means that the module is provided by the operating
system or by standard programming language libraries.  Also indicate if the
module will be implemented specifically for the software.

Only the leaf modules in the
hierarchy have to be implemented. If a dash (\emph{--}) is shown, this means
that the module is not a leaf and will not have to be implemented. Whether or
not this module is implemented depends on the programming language
selected.

\subsection{Hardware Hiding Modules (\mref{mHH})}

  the system as specified in the software requirements specification (SRS)
  documents. This module serves as a communication layer between the

\section{Traceability Matrix} \label{SecTM}

This section shows two traceability matrices: between the modules and the
requirements and between the modules and the anticipated changes.

% the table should use mref, the requirements should be named, use something
% like fref
\begin{table}[H]

\begin{tabular}{p{0.2\textwidth} p{0.6\textwidth}}
\toprule
\textbf{Req.} & \textbf{Modules}\\
\midrule

R2 & \mref{mFitg}, \mref{mRing} \\
R3 & \mref{mFitg}, \mref{mRMSD}, \mref{mE} \\

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Trace between requirements and modules.}
\label{TblRT}
\end{table}

As in Table \ref{trace-ACM}, there are two modules that change as a result of 
\acref{acInput}. The input will be divided into two modules - one module 
(\mref{mGAIn}) is responsible for handling the genetic algorithm inputs and the 
other module (\mref{mMolIn}) is responsible for handling the molecular inputs. 
The author has already written a software package that can handle molecular 
geometry (and its conversion to other formats). This package also interfaces 
with Openbabel \cite{obabel}. The author has decided to use a Behaviour-Hiding 
module for the genetic algorithm, as these algorithms are very dependent on the 
format of the data structure used to represent the problem (and thus converting 
to a format acceptable to another external program might change the results 
significantly). Furthermore, one of the goals of the program is to make the 
package work on high-performance computing clusters. If there are fewer 
external programs necessary to run \progname{}, then it will be easier to 
install the program.

\begin{table}[H]

\acref{acFit_G} & \mref{mFitg} \\

\acref{acEnergy} & \mref{mE} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Trace between anticipated changes and modules.}
\label{trace-ACM}
\end{table}

\section{Use Hierarchy Between Modules} \label{SecUse}

In this section, the uses hierarchy between modules is
provided. \citet{Parnas1978} said of two programs A and B that A {\em uses} B if
correct execution of B may be necessary for A to complete the task described in
its specification. That is, A {\em uses} B if there exist situations in which
the correct functioning of A depends upon the availability of a correct
implementation of B.  Figure \ref{FigUH} illustrates the use relation between
the modules. It can be seen that the graph is a directed acyclic graph
(DAG). Each level of the hierarchy offers a testable and usable subset of the
system, and modules in the higher level of the hierarchy are essentially simpler
because they use modules from the lower levels.

\begin{figure}[H]

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{MG_hierarchy.png}
\caption{Use hierarchy among modules. Note the hardware-hiding module has been 
omitted for clarity.}
\label{FigUH}
\end{figure}

\wss{Do any other modules use the Input module?  It is usually the case that
  other modules will ask the Input module for its values.  Or will the Control
  module be the only one that needs these values?}
\meow{The gac module will be the only one that directly accesses the two input 
modules. The gac module knows all of the inputs so that it can pass them to the 
relevant data structures/routines. In the cases where the inputs are used, they 
will be as part of the data structures or as a simple string or number. I could 
write my code such that the inputs module was an object that other modules 
could call; I just didn't think of that structure until I read your comments. 
I'm also unclear as to how that would reduce the amount of data being passed in 
my program or make it easier to follow.}
